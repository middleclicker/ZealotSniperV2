# Zealot Sniper (Version 2)

Snipes zealots for you with frozen scythe in hypixel skyblock. Version 1 was based on computer vision and pyautogui, but the mouse controls were fumbly and a pain to implement, leading to it's discontinuation.

## Installation

Head to releases and download the jar. The mod is only compatible for 1.12.2 forge. To run it, put it in your mods folder.

## Building from source

To build from source, clone the repository and run `./gradlew build`.

## Development

To setup a development environment, clone the repository and run `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`. Then, open the `build.gradle` file in your IDE (e.g. Intellij) and select `Open as Project`.

## Credits

Version 2 now uses the [CatClient](https://github.com/XeonLyfe/1.12.2-Client-Base/tree/main) as its base. It saved me a lot of time, so credit to its authors.
