# Zealot Sniper (Version 2)
Version 1 was based on computer vision and pyautogui, but the mouse controls were fumbly and a pain to implement, leading to it's discontinuation.

Version 2 now uses the CatClient base (https://github.com/XeonLyfe/1.12.2-Client-Base/tree/main).

It is a 1.12.2 mod. To run it, you can compile it yourself through gradle or download from the releases menu.
